Hello,

We had a strange error on ActiveMQ last week, and wanted to check if someon=
e has experienced this before.

Background
A couple of weeks ago we patched the ActiveMQ Prod VMs, after they were res=
tarted the wrong configuration  was setup causing a "Split brain" problem b=
etween the master and the slave.

To troubleshoot the invalid configuration before going to production we had=
 2 test VMs created to verify the update process from the previous (static =
configuration) the new configuration using Multi Cast. The testing worked a=
s expected and we were ready to update the configuration on production.

On Sept 27th the correct configuration was (same as you are currently using=
) we ended up having 2 masters and 2 slaves on at the same time - this happ=
ened because the test VMs had not been turned off yet. When we realized thi=
s, we turned the test VMs immediately. There were no errors or warnings in =
the ActiveMQ or Activity Manager logs, thus we thought there would not be a=
n issue.

A couple days after (Oct 1st) the test VMs were decommissioned, and ERRORs =
started being generated in the ActiveMQ logs, because it could not find the=
 test VMs:

Example Error Message
2024-10-01 12:40:19,056 ERROR [org.apache.activemq.artemis.core.client] AMQ=

        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method) ~[?:?=
]
        ....

On Oct 3rd at 8:15 AM the program scheduling work continued communicating w=
ith ActiveMQ, however no jobs were being pulled from the ActiveMQ queues. T=
he logs on the ActiveMQ only included the previous error I had included, an=
d there were no errors on program scheduling work.

Solution

  *   Restarted the master ActiveMQ - this solved the Failed to create nett=
y connection  ERROR
  *   Added a monitor (checkAMQLog)  script to Active MQ to get notified if=
 an ERROR or warning is triggered
  *   For future ActiveMQ debugging in test VMs -use a different port for t=
roubleshooting

We are working to perform a root cause analysis on this issue - however we =
are not able to find a specific error in the artemis log when the jobs stop=
ped being pulled from the queue. Please let me know if this behavior is exp=
ected or additional commands that can be used to troubleshoot in future if =
it were to happen again.

Thanks for your help!
Erick

Can you provide your <cluster-connections> from broker.xml? I suspect
you're using the default <reconnect-attempts> value of -1 which means that
when a broker drops out of the cluster the other nodes to which the node
was previously connected will attempt to reconnect forever and, in the
meantime, will continue routing messages for that node to the internal
store-and-forward queue.

Also, if you're using multicast discovery then you're likely sharing the
same multicast address and port between your different environments (e.g.
dev & prod) which typically isn't desirable as it allows cross-environment
clustering like you're seeing.

Lastly, if you experienced split-brain then I suspect you're using
replication for HA. If that's true then you should definitely be mitigating
split-brain as discussed in the documentation [1].
